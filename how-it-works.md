# The New Digital School

## How it works
### No fixed curriculum
Throughout the course of 10 months, the calendar will have predetermined slots. Part of these slots will be pre-filled or have defaults and the rest will be open for the students to determine what's best for them. There are 5 layers of slots available: for classes, workshops, mentoring, conferences and projects.
* **Classes** will establish the broad foundations that everyone should know.
* **Workshops** will be a path to specialise in certain very specific topics.
* **Mentoring** is the ideal way for students to acquire soft skills that are usually obtained through experience. There should be seasonal mentoring and permanent mentoring (staff)
* **Conferences** are going to solidify a web creator's personality traits and share the most up-to-date topics
* **Projects** may or not be suggested by companies. May or not be group projects. May or not have a final product. They intend to teach through experience and through being in touch with the users and the industry.


### Students with an active role in their education
Besides the booked time, students are expected to have at least 15% of autonomous learning which makes them responsible for what they want to learn and want to be evaluated by. This is a huge shift to what most people are used to.
Students learn with well known industry professionals and speakers, through research, with their peers and by being involved with real projects. Full-time teachers, mentors and industry leaders will help. But even existing teachers are more like mentors that guide students into learning the right way.
When working on real projects for real clients, students are forced to consider real world problems and constraints, while learning the most up-to-date technologies and standards.


### No traditional evaluation
At the end the student is going to either land a job, start his own practice as a freelancer/start-up/studio or can simply continue his learning for a few extra months in a seamless way.
Assessment is done in two ways. Through the company's satisfaction with the student's performance and out of the student's satisfaction and trust in his own abilities.
What matters after a course is no longer the graduation but the opportunities school bring us. So we intend to promote just that.
