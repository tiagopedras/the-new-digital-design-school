# The New Digital School

## Objectives
* To create a more suited place to learn how to be a digital designer. One that reflects the multitude of areas and skills, the fast and constant pace of evolution of the area, as well as the community's way of being. One that isn’t written in stone and is suited to be adjusted by each individual, and therefore is not validatable by the old evaluation systems.
* To promote knowledge and skill learning that is both suited for the student’s tastes as well as for the industry’s needs. By involving the industry soon in the education timeline in order to avoid out-of-date knowledge and useless skill sets, as well as to create networking with students to promote early job opportunities.

## Key players
* [Students](for-students.md)
* [Industry Partners](for-industry-partners.md)
* The Community

## Key activities
5 teaching pillars or key activities: classes, workshops, mentoring, conferences and projects. These will have different relevancy percentages throughout the school year.
* Classes will establish the broad foundations that everyone should know
* Workshops will be a way to specialise in certain very specific topics
* Mentoring is the ideal way for students to acquire soft skills that are usually obtained through experience. There should be seasonal mentoring and permanent mentoring (staff)
* Conferences are going to solidify a web creator's personality traits and share the most up-to-date topics
* Projects may or not be suggested by companies. May or not be group projects. May or not have a final product. They intend to teach through experience and through being in touch with the users and the industry
